## Publishing to GitHub

To publish this integration to your own GitHub repository:

1. In the project root, run:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Skydark Family Calendar integration"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/HunterJacobs/SkyDark.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

After pushing, others can install via HACS by adding your repo URL as a custom repository (Integration).

## Development

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev    # Vite dev server
npm run build  # Builds into custom_components/skydark_calendar/www
npm run test   # Vitest
```

### Backend

The backend is the Home Assistant custom component. Use a Python environment matching your HA version if you run tests locally. The SQLite database is created at `config/skydark_calendar/skydark_calendar.db` after the first run.

## Services

- `skydark_calendar.add_event`: title, start_time, end_time, all_day?, calendar_id?, description?, location?
- `skydark_calendar.complete_task`: task_id, completed_date?
- `skydark_calendar.add_list_item`: list_id, content
- `skydark_calendar.send_notification`: message, title?

## Automations

The integration fires `skydark_calendar_event_created` when an event is added via the service. Use it as a trigger in automations.

## Google / Microsoft Calendar

Stubs are in place (`google_calendar.py`, `microsoft_calendar.py`). Full OAuth and two-way sync can be added later.

## UI

The UI follows the Skydark reference: light background `#F8FAFB`, accent `#3B9BBF`, pastel event colors, 80px sidebar, FAB bottom-right. Optimized for landscape tablet (e.g. 15" display).
